## Cool Credits Idea \- Like Some Movies


</div>

### Description

This is a cool idea for credits for some of your programs. It is kind of like some movies you ,ay have seen. One text flys to one side and the other (at the other end) flys twoards the other side, but when the two texts come to align they slow down, but once they move back out of alignment the speed up again. Kind of confusing it sounds but it is rather easy i reccomend you just download to see for yourself. Thanks for checking it out.
